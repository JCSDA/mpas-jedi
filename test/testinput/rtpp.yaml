#The additional variables below vary across members, are contained
# in State objects and are not typically among mpas-jedi state or
# analysis variable config entries.  For RTPP, they must be specified
# as "state variables" in order for the output mean state to
# correctly reflect their average values and not be simply equal to
# member 1
#Additionally, these four variables are modified in the StateMPAS
# += operator for adding IncrementMPAS objects.  Their correct
# averaging in the mean state is required in order for the updated
# analysis ensemble to be correct after adding the RTPP perturbations.

# Additionally, although the following variables are unaffected
# in DA applications, they must be included in both the state
# and analysis variables in order for the updated analysis
# members to contain independent values; otherwise:
# missing from both state and analysis variables
#  => mean output has values equal to original analysis member 1
# missing from only analysis variables
#  => all output members equal to analysis mean
#Note: exclude hydrometeors in ctest, because not present in 480km init file
# MUST be included in cycling for correct member-by-member values
